<h2>Monday, January 23, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Got the plugin to compile on win32!<br>
<br>
Planning on starting the sprint with <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=53'>issue 53</a>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Read the wikipedia page for TCP/IP.  Having a little trouble understanding it all, but it should come with more effort and research.  I will continue to research this.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Didn't do anything since planning meeting<br>
<br>
Planning on working Derrick on detecting and handling error cases.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Didn't do anything since the planning meeting.<br>
<br>
Planning on getting some meetings in with Pete over the next couple of days when I'm not busy with other homework.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, January 24, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Researched <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=53'>issue 53</a>

Planning to continue research.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Gained a better understanding of the differences between TCP and UDP.  Will start looking through code to see what we need to do differently to implement TCP.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derrick to handle some errors<br>
<br>
Planning on researching errors<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Forgot there was a meeting, emailed group to let them know.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, January 25, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Continued research on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=53'>issue 53</a>.<br>
<br>
Slowly finding out that wireshark documentation is scarce.<br>
<br>
Will continue to research <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=53'>issue 53</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Researched more about TCP, determined that we need some TCP test data to play with before we know what we need to do to implement it.  Also, added an issue and a new "priority" column to the issue tracker.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Researched errors and made a list of ones we can/can't/"need time" to do<br>
<br>
Plan on implemented handling of errors<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Got error D2 working.  Several errors are seemingly impossible to implement.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, January 26, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=53'>issue 53</a> Made a small change that should filter out some traffic on our port,<br>
however not everything can be filtered.  Best way to go from here is watching<br>
the source and destination and ignoring traffic from others.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Worked with Derek to find what we need to do to use FAST with TCP.  Should just be a small change in one line of code, which we can do conditionally on a preference flag.  Still need some test data before this can be confirmed.  Will work with Derrick to try to debug the issue that arose yesterday.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derrick on errors, encountered a few minor problems.<br>
<br>
Planning on working on errors<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Worked with Peter on error D7, having trouble detecting that the extra bits are being used.<br>
<br>
<h2>Monday, January 31, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Worked with Mike on TCP research<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Worked with Peter and Derrick on one complicated bug in error checking.  Got some code cleaned up.  Will work on TCP research/implementation.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derrick on errors, had some errors blocking<br>
Worked on TCP/IP plan runner variant<br>
<br>
Plan on continuing TCP/IP plan runner variant<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Was sick, took the day off.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, February 01, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Worked with Peter and Mike to get TCP working.  It works!<br>
Will work on fixing the TCP preferences and <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=56'>issue 56</a>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Worked with Peter and Derek to get TCP working.  It works!  Will figure out what to do next with the group.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked on TCP with Derek and Mike.  Made TCP Plan Runner variant.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Investigated source code and made myself more familiar with the layout and coding styles.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, February 02, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Worked with Peter to try to get TCP in the regression test framework.  Will either continue working on this, or help Derrick with his error problem.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Mike to try to make TCP part of the regression tests.  Plan to continue working on this by making the Plan Runner support TCP pcap files, need to research Jpcap<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Worked with Mike to get error D7 up and working.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, February 03, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Helped Derrick to finish debugging the D7 error code.  Will probably do retrospective with the group.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Missed the meeting.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>

<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Worked Well</h2>
Derek - Research on TCP led to getting it implemented, got a lot of story points done.<br>
Derrick - Working on error checking allowed me to get a good knowledge of the code base, paired programming with Pete and Mike helped a lot, because it would have taken me a long time to figure it out on my own.<br>
Mike - I enjoyed having an opportunity to research TCP and gain knowledge on the subject.<br>
Peter - The whole team sharing knowledge to try to bring new Derrick up to speed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Didn't Work well</h2>
Derek - having the only revision of code we're working with on a laptop that isn't present (because Derrick was sick)<br>
Derrick - it was hard to understand when the other team members went off on tangents and discussed a lot of different issues, and were working on different things at the same time / helping each other with different things.<br>
Mike - initial overhead of figuring out schedules, people forgetting meeting times, changing meeting times, etc.<br>
Peter - Shuffling meeting times.  Having a single point of failure with who has the code.<br>
<br>
<h2>Try Next Time</h2>
Derek - better communication with Jake and Emmanuel<br>
Mike - have a scrummaster who shows up to the retrospective...<br>
Peter - have stuff done that can be demoed.<br>
Wallace - explain to Jake that you will start needing more input from him since you won't have a lot of stuff in the spec

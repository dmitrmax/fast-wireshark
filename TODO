* code that deals with base-10 decimals needs to be changed so that:
	- the field with a type FLT10 is used only as a pointer to two
		int32 subfields
	- the first subfield is the exponent, which also can be nullable
		and controls whether the entire field will be displayed
	- the second subfield is the mantissa
	- all the other special-case stuff related to flt10 can be removed
* sequences don't work
	- the most major thing is the setup_template_fields function needs to be
		called on-the-fly
		when a sequence is encountered, so it can construct the correct number
		of group subfields.  This will take a significant amount of work.
* XML parsing code needs to be completely rewritten
* there is a lot of potential for memory leaks.
* all the operator functions dont bounds check the PMAP array.  These
	functions should not really be allowed to modify the pmap pointer at all;
	instead the caller should determine whether they used a pmap bit by
	looking at the template_field_type flags.
* in the event of an incomplete packet, the plugin will raise an exception
	and wireshark will terminate it.  We should handle errors more gracefully
	by checking if there is data before calling tvb_get_guint8 in the
	low-level decoders
* process_fields needs to be rewritten so there are no special cases
* dictionaries are not implemented at all (6.3.1)
* ASCII fields are not properly checked for all nullability conditions
	according to the FAST spec (10.6.3)
* the Delta operator for strings is not implemented
* template reference instruction (6.4) is not implemented
* auxiliary identifiers are not implemented (7.1)
* it would be nice if we identified Dynamic errors with their proper error
	codes
* the port the plugin listens on cannot be changed without recompiling
* the flags value in template_field_struct needs to be set properly

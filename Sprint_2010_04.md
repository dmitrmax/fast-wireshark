# Sprint 4, 2010 #
Monday, November 1, 2010 - Thursday, November 11, 2010

## Goals ##
  * Get operators working for integer-based fields

## Table of Contents ##


# Stories #

## Optional Display of Optional Fields ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 43](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=43)
### Details ###
  * Only sometimes display empty optional fields.
  * New option keyed as fast.show\_empty, which can be given 'true' or 'false'.
### Acceptance Test ###
  1. Sepcify a template file with optional fields in Wireshark.
  1. In the preferences, make sure the "show empty" checkbox is unchecked.
  1. Start listening for traffic.
  1. Send some fields as empty, some as nonempty.
    * See only the nonempty fields.

## Allow not specifying a port ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 42](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=42)
### Details ###
  * Optionally disable the plugin.
### Acceptance Test ###
  1. In Wireshark, set the FAST port to 5000.
  1. Start listening, send some traffic on port 5000.
    * Observe some FAST traffic.
  1. Disable FAST dissection via the enable/disable checkbox in the plugin preferences.
  1. Stop listening, send some traffic on port 5000.
    * Observe no FAST traffic.

## Operators for decimal ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 46](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=46)
### Details ###
  * The full decimal field can have operators applied to it, such as copy, constant, default, and delta.
  * The int-based fields story ([issue 37](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=37)) took care of everything but delta.
  * Delta is essentially applying the delta to both exponent and mantissa, but with the decimal's key as the dictionary lookup.
### Acceptance Test ###
  * Initial value.
    1. Specify a template with constant and default operators and initial values.
    1. Send traffic on that template.
      * See the operators invoked and the expected result in Wireshark.
  * Apply delta.
    1. Specify a template with a delta operator on a decimal and no keys for mantissa or exponent.
    1. Send messages of that template.
      * As usual, verify it works. No segfaults should occur...

# Retrospective #
## Worked Well ##
Peter - Everybody came to meetings and did the work.  I didn't have to keep track of what everybody was doing, because things got done.  Having Alex help me with the PCAP stuff was nice.
Mike - I enjoyed doing the int operators issue, and got better at paired programming despite keyboard layout conflicts
Derek - I think we worked well together and got everything done that we set out to do, so that was good.
Alex - We took the time to not make huge switch case statements in order to make our code more maintainable.  We put some extra effort into it and as a result we were able do some work that was outside of the scope.

## Didn't Work well ##
Peter - mildly being out of the loop.  I don't think we communicated much about how things were going, but it didn't end up being much of a problem.
Alex - This time the product owner wasn't able to participate as much in the design because he was bogged down with the bugs in openfast.  Started to see the effects of not having users.
Derek - Overestimating some issues, then when I was done with some stuff, I was not able to contribute much to the more complicated issues.
Mike - compiz was slowing down my computer, so I had a lot of overhead in fixing that.

## Try Next Time ##
Peter - try doing more planning using the whiteboard, bringing everyone in on the planning.
Alex - demo on windows, and keep the windows build maintained
Mike - don't assign the product owner a lot of stuff so he can be more involved in design.



# Stand-ups #
6:00 pm - Rekhi 118


## Wednesday, November 3, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Updated rwcompare to pass the new plugin options. Also fixed the filename output by DBGN macros not be an absolute path. Updated the wiki with some acceptance tests for the new plugin option stories.

Will help Mike with operators by putting together a slew of failing tests.
### Derek ###
Added preferences to disable the plugin and enable/disable showing of empty fields.

Will work on Non-sequential dissection.
### Mike ###
Did some estimating with the group, made the sprint wiki.  Will work with Alex to get started on the operator issue.

### Peter ###
Estimated with the group.  Created stories for the sprint.  Plan on working on PCAP files.

## Thursday, November 4, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Stayed late yesterday with Mike to get generalizable operators (const/copy/default) on all fields. Today, I'll resolve an issue of optional fields which can have operators in a "length" or "exponent" subfield - a simple null check won't do!
### Derek ###
Changed disabled to enabled.  Added field ids to field displays.

Will continue to work on Non-sequential dissection.
### Mike ###
not here.  Implemented default, constant, and copy operators for all fields, and delta and increment for uint32. will work with alex over the weekend on testing to see if any of this stuff works.

### Peter ###
Looked into various java pcap libraries for java.  Found JnetPcap to be unusable.  Plan on doing more research and implementation.

## Monday, November 8, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
After Peter made the PCAP file generator, I fixed up rwcompare to call the plan runner to generate the file by default. Thus, our tests no longer have race conditions... they should be quite a bit snappier as well. Today, I'll try to get decimal value parsing figured out.
### Derek ###
Fixed some Non-sequential bugs.

Will finish Non-sequential dissection and see if plugin can be disable/enabled on the fly.

### Mike ###
Tested default operator for all fields.  Found a bug in openfast regarding the sending of bytevectors.  Will work on testing increment & delta for uint32, and possibly implement these operators for the other fields.
### Peter ###
Worked with Alex on making our own PCAP file generator, got a basic implementation done.  Had some fun figuring out network theory and random bytes in the files.  Going to fix some pcap file stuff, and implement byte messages.  Also fixed some bugs concerning ComposedScalars.

## Wednesday, November 10, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Since last time, I helped out various parties. Also implemented a reader for initial decimal value strings, but couldn't test it because OpenFAST isn't handling it. Today, I'll try to see if there's an easy fix. Otherwise, it won't get finished.
### Derek ###
Finished Non-sequential dissection.
You can now enable/disable the plugin on the fly. No need to restart wireshark.

Will prepare for demo.
### Mike ###
Implemented & tested increment & delta for int-based fields.  Planning on adding test plans to the regression test, implementing operators for length/mantissa/exponent fields, and nagging the rest of the group to fill out their standup reports on this wiki.

### Peter ###
Finished my product owner assignment.  Plan on implementing byte messages and getting ready for demo.

## Thursday, November 11, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Paired with Mike to get decimal deltas working. Afterwards, added initial value parsing to the regression tests.
### Derek ###
Prepared for demo.

Will demo.

### Mike ###
Worked with Alex to get the decimal issue done.  Will demo.
### Peter ###
Implemented byte messages and prepared for demo.

Plan on demoing and doing some minor refactoring to the plan runner

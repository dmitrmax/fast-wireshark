## Decimal and string operators ##
### Summary ###
  * [Issue 44](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=44)
  * As a FAST Developer, I would like to be able to see the attributes on your field so I can know what exactly the field is doing.
  * Currently the user has to reference the template file to locate attributes on fields.  An optional display of these fields will allow the user to see the attributes without referencing another file.
### Details ###
  * This involves adding the fields such as "optional" and any operators on the field to the display of the field by the plugin.
### Acceptance Test ###

### Summary ###
  * [Issue 47](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=47)
  * As a fast developer, I would like to be able to use all valid operators on decimal and string fields (including byte vectors).
Currently decimals and string operators are only partially implemented.
### Details ###
  * This involves finishing the implementation of the decimal and string fields (including byte vectors).
  * This includes all currently missing operators
### Acceptance Test ###

I got ascii delta working (added dissect\_ascii\_delta).  Implemented byte vector delta, but I can't test it because OpenFAST doesn't allow delta for unicode/bytevectors.  Once I get it working and tested, I will attempt to merge the bytevector delta with the ascii delta function.

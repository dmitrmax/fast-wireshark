# Stories #

## User-specified port number not used ##
  * [issue 13](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=13)
### Summary ###
User wants to specify a port number other than 1337.
### Details ###
  * When Wireshark's default port number preference number is 0, use "previously used" port number, or 1337 if none exits.
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * AT1
    1. Open Wireshark, listen on loopback interface.
    1. Set Edit->Preferences->Protocols->FAST port number to 1337.
    1. Send traffic on port 1337 with "./test/client -p 1337 --uint32 5"
      * Verify that the traffic is associated with the FAST protocol.
    1. Change port number to 2007.
    1. Send traffic on port 1337.
      * Verify that the traffic is not FAST traffic.
    1. Send traffic on port 2007 with "./test/client -p 2007 --uint32 5"
      * Verify that the traffic is associated with the FAST protocol.

## Hook up user-specified template file ##
  * [issue 17](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=17)
### Summary ###
User wants to specify a file containing FAST templates used to decode messages.
### Details ###
  * This involves a lot of restructuring, so some things, like operators, are temporarily unsupported.
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * AT1
    1. Open Wireshark, listen on loopback interface.
    1. Set Edit->Preferences->Protocols->FAST template file to a known template file with mandatory, simple fields.
    1. Send traffic to match that template with ./util/bin/client.
      * Verify that the incoming packets show match what was sent.
      * Verify the message's types are the same as in the template file.

# Retrospective #
## Worked Well ##
  * Picked up the protocol quickly.
  * A lot to demo.
  * Planned for unexpected and extra work
## Didn't Work well ##
  * Didn't pair enough.
  * Each member didn't learn significant amount of the project.
  * Lack of knowledge with tools.
  * Didn't feel like contributing.
  * Wiki got behind.
## Try Next Time ##
  * Bullpen style coding, to increase working together.
  * Keep the Wiki up to date.
  * Write acceptance tests

### Alex ###
Worked with Derek on Sunday to fix the port functionality. Added estimates and hours to the issue tracker. Updated the ./client utility example (not that it fully works, but the example is correct). Wrote a utility to invoke a graphical diff utility on changed files in svn.

I plan to write up a story about refactoring the code so it can be use templates. There's also story about a test utility which should be written.
### Derek ###
Worked with Alex to fix port functionality.  Reviewed existing source code.

### Mike ###
I worked with Peter on the openFAST test data.  Will continue working on it to make it easier to use.

### Peter ###
I worked with Mike on using openFAST to generate test data and templates for use in debugging.  The data generation went much smoother than expected.

I plan on revising the way the test data is generated to create a user editable test data structure so that code does not have to be modified to generate and run data generation.
## Wednesday, September 15, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Wrote second story on hooking up the template file. Also wrote two more stories after figuring out that FAST data can be unambiguously represented as a tree and TShark can give us such a tree.

After estimating today, I plan to start the new template file story.
### Derek ###
Worked on setting a path to user specified template file.

### Mike ###
Worked with Peter to make the openFAST test data thing easier to use.

### Peter ###
Worked with Mike on abstracting the openFAST test data generation.  Added the code to SVN. Started working out the plan for the XML structure.

I plan on expanding the XML model and further abstracting the data generation.
## Thursday, September 16, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Nothing new to report. Plan on getting the codebase ready to use templates dynamically.
### Derek ###
Finished getting FAST preferences in wireshark to work with fast plug in.
Reviewed libxml2 for parsing user-specified template files.

### Mike ###
Nothing new.  Going to work on generating test data for openFAST operators
### Peter ###
Looked at a few XML libraries for Java.  Decided on Apache Xerces.

Implementing usage of Xerces to read and write test data.
## Monday, September 20, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Revamped codebase to structure templates as trees, added doxygen, figured out how Wireshark's protocol display tree works, and started using it correctly.

Over the next two days, I plan to get all field types printing correctly and hook up the xml template file parser to the plugin so we can finally rid ourselves of 'setup.c'.
### Derek ###
Wrote separate template parsing test program (In test/openFastXMLTest)
Program just reads in template data and prints it back out.

### Mike ###
Struggled with Eclipse for a while, then got some operators working in the template files.  Will continue to work on this, to get the other operators working.
### Peter ###
I implemented XML file parsing for running data generation plans.  I also refactored the existing code base some.

I plan on generalizing the code so that it accepts command line arguments so that it can be packaged into a .jar file and run from the command line.
## Wednesday, September 22, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Implemented other field displays. For the demo tomorrow, I'll have some fields hooked up, so we can load templates dynamically.

### Derek ###
Finished connecting template parsing to existing source.  Decimals, Strings, and Operators now parse and connect with dissector.

### Mike ###
Got all the operators working properly (except for "tail"), committed new templates and test plan xml files.  Not really sure what we're supposed to do with tail, or what the difference is between it and delta.
### Peter ###
I started work on making the data runner accept command line arguments.

I will finish letting the runner accept command line arguments and prepare for the Sprint Demo.

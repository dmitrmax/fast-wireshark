<h2>Tuesday, March 15, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Estimated, plan on starting on source and destination tracking.<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Estimated with the group.  Will start working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=74'>issue 74</a>, error logs<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Estimated, plan on starting on source and destination tracking.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Did estimations and planning.  Going to start working on cleaning up the build.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, March 16, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Made a generic dynamic errors function.  Will work on integrating it with the rest of the code, and get it to write to a log file.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Made a plan with Derek on what needs to change and how for source and destination tracking.  Plan on pairing with Derek to start getting it done.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Researched cmake rules to try to figure out how stuff works well enough to be able to make a make dev.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, March 17, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Got the generic error function working and integrated it with the rest of the code and regression test framework.  Will add the log file capability next.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derek on source and destination tracking<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
I went through a lot of the CMake documentation, I found a few different commands that could do the job, but no good examples / context for any of them to figure out how they work.  If I'm unable to find anything soon I may just have to try mashing until it works.<br>
<br>
<h2>Monday, March 21, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Got error log working for dynamic errors.  Will start working on info column issue.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derek on source and destination tracking<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Learned more about CMake and how we are using it.  The way our cmakelists.txt is structured, using the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable is out of the question.  If there was a variable for whether or not it's being run in test mode it could be done easily, but the wiki says that documentation is incomplete.  The include also cannot be added to the testing section because apparently CMake doesn't like it.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, March 22, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Got template id and name displaying in info columns.  Will work on displaying something different for multi-message packets.  Might start working on static error stuff too.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derek on source and destination tracking, compiles<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
I'm not sure that CMake can do what we want the way we want, going to talk go the group about it.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, March 23, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Added functionality for different information in the info column (for multiple messages and dynamic errors).  Will look into issue with the customer's capture file that doesn't work.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derek on source and destination tracking, got it to pass tests.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Continued working on CMake, I'm impeded by the fact that the one we have now is not written in a way to support multiple release modes even if we can change it by commenting out a single line, and I believe it needs to be completely re-written unless I'm missing something obvious.<br>
<br>

<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Prepared for demo, will demo.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Prepared for demo, will demo.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
We're going to be moving this issue on to the next sprint.<br>
<br>
<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Worked Well</h2>
We accomplished a lot.<br>
<br>
<h2>Didn't Work well</h2>
Our users tend to not get back to us.<br>
Monitors.<br>
Wasn't really sure what to do when I hit a road block, should have worked on something else or got help (group members were busy).<br>
<br>
<h2>Try Next Time</h2>
Need to overestimate stuff that we're not really sure on rather than underestimating.  We can also re-estimate stories once we actually understand what they fully entail.<br>
<br>
Have each person pull in their own issues instead of pulling them all in at the beginning.<br>
<br>
Get a different lab with working hardware.

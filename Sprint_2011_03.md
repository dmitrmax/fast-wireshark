<h2>Wednesday, February 23, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Estimated.  Setup a VM to test windows build scripts.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Estimated with the group, started looking at my issue.  Will start working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=51'>issue 51</a>

<h3>Peter</h3>

<h3>Derrick</h3>
Estimated.  Started looking at the install README's for linux (<a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=64'>issue 64</a>).  Planning to start working on them.  Also meeting with Jake tomorrow.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, February 24, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Added a few build scripts for windows.<br>
Still testing and adding error checking.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Dissected a bunch of FAST packets using sample CME and UMDF data from Jake.  It appears to be working fine, but I'm not sure how to confirm that everything got dissected correctly.  I might start working on researching source/destination tracking (<a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=68'>issue 68</a>)<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Wrote up some documentation for the openFAST Plan Runner.  Refactored Java code to remove useless package structures.<br>
<br>
Plan on researching source/destination tracking.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Updated the linux portion of the README file so that it's no longer outdated.  The top of the file still says that it's outdated though, so when the windows portion is updated that should be removed.<br>
<br>
Met with Jake, will talk over the details during the meeting.<br>
<br>
<h2>Monday, February 28, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Build scripts are completely working.<br>
Just need to add some more error checking and test on<br>
a fresh windows install.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Recommitted changes to dissect.c that had been rudely overwritten by peter (though he claims it was svn's fault - don't believe him).  Pulled in <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=67'>issue 67</a> to the sprint, and started working on it.  I think I've got it implemented correctly for a few of the cases, will continue working on it on monday.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Updated documentation for OpenFAST Test Runner.  Did some minor research into how to make the plugin filter source and destination.<br>
<br>
Planning on continuing with source and destination tracking.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Updated README.nix to have Fedora package names and commands.  Assuming the Ubuntu portion is correct then it should be good to go.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, March 1, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Finished Build Scripts<br>
Setup another VM to make sure build scripts work on a fresh machine.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Implemented Error D6, and got it to work for increment, copy, and delta int ops.  Will make sure that this works and didn't break anything else, then commit.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Did some research into filtering source and destination, seems impossible based on found documentation.  Better documentation would make this a lot easier.<br>
<br>
Planning on doing more research and resolving user errors.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Went over the user documentation, as far as I can tell it should be good for the upcoming release.  Looked at some of the wireshark documentation with Pete.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, March 2, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Prepared for demo.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Finished <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=67'>Issue 67</a> by adding a test to the regression framework.  I don't know what there is to do next.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Attempted to handle a user error, did minor research into Source and Destination tracking<br>
<br>
Planning on continuing with source/destination tracking<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Looked at the issue from our user with Pete.  Double checked documentation since he claimed it was insufficient, but according to Pete's test it should be fine.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, March 3, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Demo day.<br>

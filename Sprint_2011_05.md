<h2>Tuesday, March 29, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Did retrospective and planning, will work on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=77'>issue 77</a>, info column stuff.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Working on Plan Runner to make network testing possible.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Did retrospective and planning.  Going to work with Derek on cleaning up the build.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, March 30, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Finished <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=77'>Issue 77</a>: worked out bugs in info column, cleaned up code a bit.  Will find something new to work on.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked on Plan Runner for network testing<br>
<br>
Planning on continuing<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Updated the Linux build.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, March 31, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Started working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=83'>Issue 83</a>: combining split packets.  I think I've mostly figured out how to do it for TCP, but still have no idea what to do for UDP.  Will continue working on it.  Impeded, as usual, by the complete lack of documentation for wireshark development.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked on making java send/receive across network.  Sends, doesn't receive.<br>
<br>
Continuing on this venture.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Worked with Derek on cleaning up the build, we found some new stuff but nothing worked.<br>
<br>
<h2>Monday, April 4, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Continued working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=83'>Issue 83</a>, but made no progress.  I am now more confused than when I began.  Hopefully I'll get something done on it next time.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked on the java plan runner to support networking.  Had fun with making channels work.<br>
<br>
Planning on actually doing some network tests<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Worked with Derek to implement an alternative solution to <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=79'>Issue 79</a>.  Started to look into <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=82'>Issue 82</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, April 5, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Spent the whole time troubleshooting why my regression tests were failing, only to realize it's because I had wireshark set to TCP.  Will continue to try to find something out for combining split packets.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Mike to trouble shoot his failing tests.<br>
<br>
Got basic network testing done, plugin appears to handle it well.<br>
<br>
Planning on making pcap files support multiple sender/receivers and integrate it into our pcap file generator.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Found an old test case I could use to test having multiple messages in the same packet, which gave me the illusion that it already worked properly.  However, the plan runner currently is actually creating multiple packets from the plan file + byte message, so I cannot test it properly.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, April 6, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
Realized that reassembling split packets won't work in our current setup, but we'll have to make a separate plugin for UMDF (and probably CME), and have that plugin call the FAST plugin in order to get split packets working.  Will start working on that tomorrow.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>

<h3>Derrick</h3>
Found a function that might do what we need to do.  But it's going to take a bit of work to integrate it into the code which I've been looking at.<br>
<br>
Added a new option for it too.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, April 7, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>

<h3>Mike</h3>
found a function that should allow us to force packet colorization, and then spent two hours trying to figure out why it doesn't work properly.  Will attend demo, but have little to show.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>

<h3>Derrick</h3>
Did the demo.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Worked Well</h2>
Info column stuff worked well.<br>
Static errors implemented.<br>
Having a backlog is nice.<br>
Using the wireshark help forum saved time.<br>
<br>
<h2>Didn't Work well</h2>
Having a bunch of issues without knowing if they are possible.<br>
Lack of wireshark implementation knowledge.<br>
Not a lot to demo.<br>
Working on dead end stories.<br>
<br>
<h2>Try Next Time</h2>
Document.<br>
Do whatever we can to leave the project in a state that others can use.

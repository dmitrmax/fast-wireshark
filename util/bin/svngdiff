# The environment variables:
# GDIFF and EDITOR can override what command is used to display
# a diff or view a newly added file (respectively).
# I suggest installing 'xxdiff', which is used by default.
# For the viewing new files, 'less' is used by default.
#
# To use gvim, put:
#   export GDIFF='gvim -fd'
#   export EDITOR='gvim -f'
# in your ~/.bashrc file.

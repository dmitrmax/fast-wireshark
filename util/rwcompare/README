RWCOMPARE README
______________________________________________________________________________
--- Description

rwcompare is a dev tool made to make running regression tests on the project
simpler.

The primary functionality of rwcompare is to run a test plan through the
Plan Runner to generate a pcap file.  Then to use tshark to read the pcap
file and convert it to a pdml file containing the interpreted FAST data.
The pdml file is then converted into a plan file which is then compared
against the expected result plan file to check for correctness.

The general concept is if we get out what we put it, the plugin works.  Or 
if we get what we expected (in the case of FAST errors).

Short depiction of the functionality:
plan1 -> pcap -> pdml -> plan2 -> diff plan1 plan2

--- Building

After following the directions for building the project in the root of the
project, rwcompare can be built by calling make in this directory or the
project's root directory.

--- Notes for maintainers

To add functionality via command line rwcompare.c's main will need to be
modified.

This is a dev tool, therefore good maintainable programming practices were
skipped at times in favor of quick implementations to test features of the
main project.

CLIENT README
______________________________________________________________________________
--- Description

client is a dev tool made in the early stages of the project to send FAST
encoded network data.

client encodes data to its respective FAST encoding then sends it over the
network.  There is no state maintained and each run is a new packet to send.

client is fully replaced by the Plan Runner.

______________________________________________________________________________
--- Building

After following the directions for building the project in the root of the
project, client can be built by calling make in this directory or the
project's root directory.

--- Notes for maintainers

This utility could eventually replace the Plan Runner if it is given state
handling and plan handling.  If this is not the intention, then the Plan
Runner should be used and this should not be updated.

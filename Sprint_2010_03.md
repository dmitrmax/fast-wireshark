Wednesday, October 13, 2010 - Monday, October 25, 2010

## Goals ##
  * Get Dictionaries and Nullable Types working.

## Table of Contents ##


# Stories #

## Template and Field Names ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 31](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=31)
### Details ###
  * Make template names & field names display in wireshark
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Load template file with specified template and field names
  * Generate fast data using DataPlanRunner
  * Verify the correct field names are displayed in wireshark

## Byte Vectors ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 27](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=27)
### Details ###
  * Decode Byte Vectors
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Listen for fast traffic with wireshark
  * Use DataPlanRunner to send fast data containing byte vectors
  * Verify Wireshark displays byte vector content correctly

## Windows Installer ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 33](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=33)
### Details ###
  * Implement fast plugin installer for windows
  * Scope limited to 32bit only as we nobody has a 64bit dev environment up.
  * A simple 'install.bat' is sufficient because CMake generates an NSIS installer script with syntax errors. Nontrivial to debug.
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Install wireshark on windows system
  * Run the fast plugin installer
  * Verify that wireshark can dissect fast data

## Dictionaries ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 28](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=28)
### Details ###
  * Implement Dictionaries and copy operator
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Listen for fast traffic with wireshark
  * Generate fast data containing copy operators using DataPlanRunner
  * Verify that dictionaries are working correctly

## Nullable Types ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 29](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=29)
### Details ###
  * Implement nullable types
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Listen for fast traffic with wireshark
  * Generate fast data containing option fields using DataPlanRunner
  * Verify that optional fields are working correctly


## Merge Dictionaries & Nullable Types ##
### Summary ###
  * [issue 30](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=30)
### Details ###
  * Combine dictionaries and nullable types so they can be used together
### Acceptance Tests ###
  * Listen for fast traffic with wireshark
  * Generate fast data containing option fields and copy operators using DataPlanRunner
  * Verify that optional fields and dictionaries are working correctly




# Retrospective #
## Worked Well ##
## Didn't Work well ##
## Try Next Time ##


# Stand-ups #
6:00 pm - Rekhi 118

## Wednesday, October 13, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Didn't have a stand-up, don't plan on doing anything until the weekend.
### Derek ###
### Mike ###
Went to Madison.  Didn't do much else.
### Peter ###
Out of sprint design spike.

Work on dictionaries.

## Thursday, October 14, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Nothing to report, will start work on nullable fields after the meeting and over the weekend with Mike.
### Derek ###
Will start working on Dictionaries with Pete
### Mike ###
Did some work for product owner assignment, set up a time to meet with Jake over Skype.  I plan on working with Alex on the Nullable Fields issue, and will meet with Jake and finish the product owner assignment.
### Peter ###
Looked into some glib functions for use in implementing dictionaries.

Work with Derek on dictionaries. Implement the setting of dictionary pointers, and basic usage.
## Monday, October 18, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Met with Mike on Saturday. We put together a working implementation for unsigned integers using no operator. This step had the overhead of doing some refactoring. We also had to get a better understanding of how operators work.

Today, I'll see what needs to be done. The byte vector or field name story are options, but are dependent on Mike's feedback from Jake. Probably will not do much until Wednesday.
### Derek ###
Worked with Pete over the weekend.  Got Dictionaries to parse from xml correctly.  Also created debug print functions to print the internal field tree.
### Mike ###
Worked with Alex, got started on the Nullable types story.  Will continue to work on this.

### Peter ###

## Wednesday, October 20, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Discussed [issue 33](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=33) with Mike (Win32 installer). From that, we decided a system-wide install will suffice... so long as the plugin is not used when a user doesn't want to use it. So I set it up such that when building in 'release' mode, the install destination will be a system-wide one. Also found out that it's impossible to have CMake have 'make test' depend on 'make install'.

Today, more work on nullable fields.
### Derek ###
Identified where, when to call dictionary functions from the dissector. Wrote some test cases to check if dictionaries are working.
### Mike ###
Worked on [Issue 29](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=29) (nullable types) with Alex, but it failed the regression test and I don't know why.  Also I spoke with Jake and finished my scrumming with the client assignment.
### Peter ###
Worked on starting implementation of deep copying for dictionaries.

Plan to work with Derek on adding dictionary code to plugin and writing tests.

## Thursday, October 21, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Paired with Mike again on the nullable fields story. Stayed late to make the dissector support optional fields which are actually empty.

Today, even more nullable fields! We have to break up some work... and work out who will demo what.
### Derek ###
Worked on dictionaries.

Plan on working on [issue 31](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=31) and [issue 32](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=32)
### Mike ###
Worked with Alex on nullable types again.  Got some stuff working.  Will work today on merging what we have with dictionaries.  After that, I'm not sure what I'll do.
### Peter ###
Worked on dictionaries

Plan on finishing dictionaries for uint32 and working on Java byte vector.
## Monday, October 25, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Met with everyone over the weekend to do the dictionary/optional merging story. Sent Derek the 32bit Windows installer to test out and demo. Functionalized empty field handling and PMAP dissecting, which cleaned up code and got the rest of the optional fields working.

    1. Run the tests.
      * Verify at least one test fails.
  * Test failure from data.
    1. Change an integer value in an expected Plan file.
    1. Run the tests.
      * Verify the test with modified expected results fails.

### Acceptance Tests ###

# Retrospective #
## Worked Well ##
  * Group members felt like they contributed value to to team and project.
  * Even though members were working on different tasks, the products came together smoothly in the end.
  * Good and lots of communication.
  * Working together allowed for spreading of knowledge.
  * Dictionary Research went well to make the team aware of the specifics and how they work.
  * Constant wiki updates.
## Didn't Work well ##
  * Members didn't enjoy not contributing code, specifically due to lack of deep understanding.
  * Underestimation of a few of the tasks.
  * Last minute notice of vacations.
  * Focused development making specialists with no general knowledge of the project.
## Try Next Time ##
  * Mention vacations at start.
  * Generalize work so that knowledge gets spread.
  * Paired Bull Penning
  * Add identifiers to commits (Issue number)

# Stand-ups #
6:00 pm - Rekhi 118
## Monday, September 27, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
What? We didn't have a stand-up today.
### Derek ###
### Mike ###
Nothing to report other than what was mentioned during retrospective/estimating.  Will install Visual Studio and start working on the windows build.
### Peter ###

## Wednesday, September 29, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Nothing to report beyond what we discussed Monday during the retrospective/estimating/planning session. Today, I plan to go over the dissector's workings with the team, which is effectively starting on the "groups" story
### Derek ###
Nothing done since Monday.
### Mike ###
Took 4 hours to download/install visual studio.  Might play around with the windows build if I get around to it.  We will also spend some time getting familiar with the plugin code
### Peter ###
Nothing done since Monday's retrospective/estimate/planning/mini standup meeting.

Plan to work on [issue 22](https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=22), to add UDP packet sending to the OpenFAST Test Plan Runner.
## Thursday, September 30, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Went through the "groups" story with the team after Wednesday's stand-up. The plugin end of it is close to complete, as everybody knows. This weekend, I plan to work on getting sequences down in the plugin. After that, the regression test story should get pretty far, but is reliant on the PDML parsing story.
### Derek ###
Finished parsing of Groups and Sequences in template xml files.
### Mike ###
Didn't get around to working on the windows build yet.  Will work on it this weekend.  Will also work with the team on groups/sequences.
### Peter ###
Added UDP loopback support to DataPlanRunner.

Adding groups and sequences to the DataPlanRunner
## Monday, October 4, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
On Thursday, discussed with Mike the need for dictionaries to be researched. The Windows build task was holding him up, so I offered to take it so he could do product owner duties. So I started on the Windows build. After some research, I decided switching the plugin build system to CMake was a worthwhile endeavor, despite being a 3 point story. I looked at the Jam build system before it, though it lacks some nice features. Eventually got CMake working and a built Windows plugin, though the .dll isn't statically linking... hoping to scope that out to a "release" story, since CMake supports creating installer packages. Along with that, documentation was updated for both Windows and `*`NIX systems. I also implemented sequences in the plugin which was pretty trivial. Later Sunday, I started the regression test story and figured out as far as how to properly execute a program from GLib. It's coded up, but untested.

By Wednesday, I hope to have more of the regression test story completed.
### Derek ###
Still working on pdml to plan file parsing.  Plan to have that done by Wednesday.
### Mike ###
Worked with the team on groups & sequences for awhile.  Discussed various things with Alex (see Alex's comment), researched dictionaries, templateRef, and typeRef.  Some things are still not very clear (the spec is poorly written), so I will try to find more documentation to figure out what some of this stuff does.  I will type up my notes and send them out to the group, and we'll discuss it on Wednesday.
### Peter ###
Added support for groups and sequences to the DataPlanRunner.

Will do maintenance on DataPlanRunner and set up tests for the runner and plugin.
## Wednesday, October 6, 2010 ##
### Alex ###
Finished rwcompare utility as far as the regression test story is concerned.
For tomorrow, I have to prep the Windows build for tomorrow's demo.
### Derek ###
Finished pdml to plan file parsing.
Will fix a few minor formating issues, and merge pdmlParser with rwcompare utility
in preparation for demo.
### Mike ###
I researched dictionaries, templateref, and typeref some more, and typed up my notes and sent it out as an email.  I will explain everything to the group and I will begin writing stories for next sprint.
### Peter ###
Started on basic data generation for demo.

Will create some basic data for demo.

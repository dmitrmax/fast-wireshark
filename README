Before you can build the plugin, you will need a built version of the
Wireshark source tree somewhere.  You can get it from:
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Extract the package to some folder somewhere, then run:
./configure
make

It should work normally, unless it needs a package that you don't have, in
which case, install it!

Then in your SVN folder of this project, run our configure script.
It requires two parameters, the path to the root folder of the wireshark
source you just built, and a path to the place you want the output shared
object to be placed at.  NOTE: these paths should NOT have trailing slashes
Example:
./configure /home/wes/mtu/design/wireshark-2.0.6 /home/wes/mtu/design

If there are no errors then you can run make:
make

Note that typically, Wireshark's plugin folder is ~/.wireshark/plugins
so you can just have the .so built there and it should work

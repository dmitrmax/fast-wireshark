Before you can build the plugin, you will need a built version of the
Wireshark source tree somewhere.  You can get it from:
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Extract the package to some folder somewhere, then run:
./configure; make

note that you DO NOT need to run 'make install' unless you don't have a
version of wireshark isntalled already, obviously.
If you do install from source, remember to do a 'sudo ldconfig' afterwards
to refresh your shared object cache or wireshark will not be able to find
all its shared objects.

It should work normally, unless it needs a package that you don't have, in
which case, install it!

-------------

Then in your source folder of this project, run our configure script.
It takes two parameters, the path to the root folder of the wireshark
source you just built, and a path to the place you want the output shared
object to be placed at:

./configure path_to_wireshark_source [path_to_so_output_folder]

The output path will default to ~/.wireshark/plugins, as this is the typical
place for wireshark's plugin folder to be located

-------------

Then you can run make:
make

Note that typically, Wireshark's plugin folder is ~/.wireshark/plugins
so you can just have the .so built there and it should work

Another note:
make clean
will clean up the detritus of the build process (INCLUDING the output .so file)
and remove the generated Makefile, so you will have to run configure to be
able to build again.

<h2>Wednesday, February 9, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Going to start working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=34'>issue 34</a> windows 64bit installer.<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
I made a wiki and worked with the group to do sprint planning.  Will start working on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=60'>issue 60</a>, errors D5 and D6.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Going to start on displaying ERR D9.<br>
<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Starting to work on <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=63'>Issue 63</a> - Working on researching how to and then displaying errors using the Wireshark API.<br>
<br>
<h2>Monday, February 14, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
Made a few scripts to hopefully make compiling on windows easier,<br>
and Installed a 64bit windows on my laptop.  Now on to getting<br>
wireshark and the plugin to compile on 64bit...<br>
<br>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Started implementing <a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=60'>issue 60</a> - D5 and D6, will work on finishing it and testing it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked on detecting when a template is not available and building a message by hand.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Searched for documentation on the Wireshark API, only to find that what documentation there was is very poor.  There was no clear documentation on how to make plugins, so I'm currently just trying to hack in some code that will work.<br>
<br>
<h2>Tuesday, February 15, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Ran into a lot pf problems with implementing errors D5 and D6 (<a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=60'>Issue 60</a>).  It may take more work than we had expected.  Will continue working on it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Worked with Derrick and Mike on resolving their issues.  Found where code needs to be added to resolve missing templates.<br>
<br>
Plan on continuing missing templates.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Founnd exactly where I need to add in code for a dialogue, however we currently aren't using any libraries with gui capabilities.  I've installed GTK+ and I'm working on how to add it to the build.<br>
<br>
<h2>Wednesday, February 16, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<h3>Mike</h3>
<a href='https://code.google.com/p/fast-wireshark/issues/detail?id=60'>Issue 60</a>: Implemented and tested error D5 for copy and increment on int32 and int64, respectively.  Will add to regression test, and start working on D6.<br>
<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Working on getting template not found to display correctly.  Hard coding in a template and data to display the error.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Having some issues finding out how to add GTK to cmake, it doesn't seem like it's possible via normal means.  Going to continue to work on it.<br>
<br>
<h2>Thursday, February 17, 2011</h2>
<h3>Derek</h3>
<h3>Mike</h3>
Added Error D5 to the regression test, and cleaned up some unnecessary code.  Will demo Error D5 and TCP.<br>
<h3>Peter</h3>
Added Missing template to the regression and build.  Preped for demo.<br>
<h3>Derrick</h3>
Got the error box to display properly.  The error message doesn't currently append the file location or halt the changes from being saved, but those are to be looked into later.<br>
<br>
<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Worked Well</h2>
Peter - we all had specific things to do, were fairly knowledgeable at what we were working on.  We made decisions as we went, and that worked well.<br>
Derrick - leaving room for flexibility was important, especially with the research issues.<br>
<br>
<h2>Didn't Work well</h2>
Derek - Demo didn't go well, skype had issues, didn't expect to have as many issues with visual studio / 64 bit windows<br>
Mike - Skype is buggy, we couldn't get the demo working well, we underestimated a few issues.  We didn't have as many days as in a normal sprint, with winter carnival and sickness<br>
Peter - We jumped into some issues blindly.  We'll need more communication with Jake and Emmanuel<br>
<br>
<h2>Try Next Time</h2>
Derrick - find alternatives to skype on linux (unreliable)<br>
Peter - try to schedule in-person meetings whenever possible, update our version numbers<br>
Mike - we need to focus on documentation and stability this coming sprint, to get ready for the press release<br>
Peter - plan out our demo farther in advance.

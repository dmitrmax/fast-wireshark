### Alex ###
Set up a template Wiki for the first sprint. Wrote up 4 user stories which reflect the project's current state. Had a back-and-forth with Jake about the first sprint's content. He's okay with leaving new FAST functionality support out of the sprint. Also spent a long while reviewing the protocol to figure out how to best beak up the OpenFAST coding. I also spent some time getting a Windows environment running... it's not building our plugin yet.

Today, I'll go over the user-stories on our critical path so everyone has an idea of how much work is involved for estimating on Thursday. I'd like to get my Windows env up also, but there may be some hangups due to unfamiliarity.

No impediments.

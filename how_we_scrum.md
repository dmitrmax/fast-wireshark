Description of daily scrum:

We usually meet at either 5pm or 2pm.  We meet in the HCI lab, usually around the four desks in the middle of the room if they are not taken.  Since the computers in the HCI lab are pretty much worthless, we all bring our laptops in and hook them up to the keyboards/mice/monitors.  This adds a small amount of extra overhead to every meeting that could be eliminated with better machines.  We get started at about ten after, sometimes because we're waiting for someone to show up, other times because the scrum master forgets that he's supposed to start the meeting.  The scrum master will start things off by saying something like "who wants to start?", and someone will start talking about what they did (we don't actually stand up).  A lot of times, the standup isn't very helpful, because I already knew what they were doing, or their work doesn't affect what I'm doing.  Sometimes it's useful, though, to know how everyone is progressing.  Sometimes the standup gets off topic, going on rabbit trails on a particular bug or issue.  Ideally the scrum master would keep things on topic, but we usually forget that it's our job to do that (since it's always changing).  Once standup has finished, we just start working on our issues.  We found that the easiest way to get things done is for each of us to work on separate issues, but work in the same place at the same time, so that when we have questions, we can ask for help.  We usually all stay for about an hour or so to work on issues, and then people leave whenever they get to a good stopping point or if they need to go.

We meet four times a week for about 2 hours.  The “stand-up” meetings themselves are only 10-15min (as they should be).  I put “stand-up” in quotes because we normally are too lazy to stand, but the point of standing is to keep it short, so we just make sure to keep the “stand-ups” sort.  During the stands-ups we take turns briefly summarizing what we have done since the last meeting, as well as what we plan to do after the meeting, and whether or not we have any road blocks with what we are working on.  These meetings have been great at keeping us up to date on the progress of others, as well helping us anticipate what issues/blocks others might have and adjust our tasks to address the problems before they have a large impact on our time.  Another thing we have been doing is writing a summary of what we said at the meeting and posting it on our wiki page.  Personally, I didn’t find much value in that.  We had a small team and met several times a week, so meetings were always fresh in our minds.  Also team member’s tasks and progress changed so frequently that old stand-up reports were generally not relevant after a day or two.  Written reports probably would be more beneficial if the teams were large, didn’t meet often, or frequently had missing members.

One thing that our team did, that I would recommend to any new students is to stay for an hour or two after the meetings.  Developing in close proximity during this time speed up everyone’s development time.  Much of this time we spent asking others how their code worked, or if they knew anything about the task we were working on.  This way we didn’t have to constantly wait for emails or phone calls to answer our questions.  It also helped to spread knowledge around and increase the overall efficiency of the team.  It also was nice because it allowed us to get most of our work done during meetings, meaning we rarely had to worry about finding time to work outside of our regular schedule.

We meet at 5:00 p.m. M/W/R and 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday.  Sometimes we are early and other times we are late, there's no real standards.  If someone is later than 15 minutes without notification, then we start without them.  We originally sat in certain spots every time but now we sort of sit wherever we feel like, based on whether or not anyone is already there and what hardware is available at the desk positions.  However we do stay in the middle of the room.

Once everyone is there and set up, normally we start right away but sometimes the scrum master may not remember it's their job to initiate the meeting, or even remember that they're scrum-master at all.  I don't blame this on the scrum-master so much as the constant position rotating.

We take turns saying what we have done, what is or isn't impeding us, and what we plan on doing.  Of course if we have any impediments this is a good time to bring it up, and if it's something that will take significant time or team work than time can be allotted to work on it after the meeting.  We don't always follow through with this, and it can cause our stand-up to last longer than it needs to.  I think if we had a dedicated scrum-master it would definitely be their responsibility to take care of staying on topic here.

After the stand up we immediately get to working, and work together as is appropriate.  How long we spend working can vary from half an hour to two hours (normally an hour and some change) depending on how much we have to work on and how much is getting done.

Personally I am often distracted by the other groups in the room, the louder ones more-so than others.  We are fairly lighthearted about work and stray off topic from time to time.  This wasn't originally an issue, but as our project nears completion those off-topic times have become more frequent and longer.

The standard stand up meeting for our group is a bit more relaxed than it should be for scrum.  We all gather in the meeting room (generally the 118 Rheki), and wait for the group to arrive.  We frequently have late people, myself included, and start generally 5-10 minutes late.  If someone is no-show for 15 minutes we just conduct the meeting without them.  We also have minor issues with the current scrum master forgetting they are the scrum master and not starting the meeting.

Once the meeting begins we remain sitting go in a random order describing what we did between the previous meeting.  This generally is old news to us and the majority of our work time is right after the stand up and thus we all know what each other are working on.  The "what are you going to do?" question is another repeat of information as everyone has the issues they want to do that sprint already decided.  Impediments are generally waiting on another team member to finish their task, or involve reading through library documentation yourself.

Our meetings tend to go off topic frequently which is probably due to the relaxed environment and sitting down.  The constantly switching roles leads to people forgetting their current job.   Our work time after the stand up keeps the project moving forward at a steady pace as we are free to bounce questions off of each other.

## consensus ##
  * sometimes late
  * start without people after 15 minutes
  * sit in center of room
  * scrummaster sometimes forgets they're in charge
  * sometimes go off topic in meetings
  * would be easier if we had a dedicated scrummaster
  * work together on issues after meeting (0.5 - 2 hours)
  * often distracted by other groups
  * lost motivation recently
  * usually more relaxed than it should be
  * stand up meeting is usually old news
  * don't stand up, generally keep it short
  * don't find much value in writing standup summaries
  * spending time after meetings to develop is a good idea and keeps us moving
  * working in the same room together increases efficiency
  * HCI computers are worthless, bring in our own laptops
  * whiteboard might be useful

## changes ##
  * fewer standup meetings, but keep working together
  * not writing standup summaries
  * install linux on the HCI computers
  * ensure constant communication with customer
  * rotate scrummaster/product owner less
  * make sure to get all the necessary knowledge from members that are leaving
  * rotate story "flavors"


# Part 3 #

The daily scrum for the FAST Wireshark team consists mainly of the standup meeting followed by development as a group for an hour or more.  At our standup meeting, we don't actually stand up (like we're supposed to), but we do follow the normal scrum procedure of going around and asking each person what they did the day before, what they're planning on doing next, and any roadblocks they have.  Sometimes the standup meetings aren't very productive, because they get started late, they get off topic, and/or the scrum master doesn't realize he's supposed to be in charge.  We found that rotating scrum master and product owner roles made it difficult for people to remember what job they were supposed to be doing.  We would suggest that for future teams, the roles should be rotated only once per semester or not at all.  This may have solved a lot of the problems we encountered.  For example, we had a hard time remembering to set up times with Prof. Wallace and Jake, our customer, to have our demo meetings.

We also found that a lot of times, since we did most of our development together, the standup meeting was not necessary.  We probably could have done weekly standup meetings instead, because we already knew what each person was doing, and we usually didn't have any new impediments, because we worked so closely together anyway.  Also, we typed up our standup meeting notes and posted them to our wiki, but looking back, this did not add any significant value to the project.  None of us actually looked back at any of our standup notes.

As for the development, we found that it makes things a lot easier to be in the same room as each other while working on separate issues.  That way, each person has something to do, and whenever one of us runs into a road block, they can enlist the help of someone else on the team.  We like this method a lot better than paired programming (where one person does all the work while the other person twiddles his thumbs), and a lot better than programming alone.

Also, using the HCI lab for our development was not the most ideal environment for productivity.  The computers in that lab are pretty much worthless, especially since we needed to do our development in linux, so we all brought in our laptops.  Also, there were usually other groups meeting in that room, which causes a distraction for us.  If we could do it all over again, we would probably meet in a private room in the library.

When planning for a new sprint, we would suggest diversifying the types of issues that each person works on.  We tended to assign issues to people who were familiar with that particular domain, instead of spreading things around, so that different people get experience in different domains.  This made things especially hard when half-way through the school year one of our team members graduated.  We lost a lot of knowledge on certain subjects when he left.
